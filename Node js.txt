Node.js overview

In basic terms, Node is an open source cross-platform library for server-side programming that permits clients to develop web applications rapidly. With Node, we can execute JavaScript applications or network applications. Its basic modules are engraved in JavaScript.
It is generally utilized for server applications in real-time. Node.js permits JavaScript to execute locally on a machine or a server.
Node.js gives numerous systems to utilize. One of such structures is Express.js. It is more valuable and mainstream than the different structures of Node.js.


Features of Node.js
•Versatility: Node is incredibly adaptable as the server reacts in a non-blocking way.
•Zero Buffering: Applications yield the measurements in enormous pieces. This gives the advantage of ‘No buffering’ to developers.
•Network: Node.js upholds an open-source community. This is the main explanation that numerous glorious modules have been added to Node.js applications over time.


Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides various features that make web application development fast and easy which otherwise takes more time using only Node.js.
Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. So, any middleware which is based on connect will also work with Express.js.

Advantages of Express.js
1.Makes Node.js web application development fast and easy.
2.Easy to configure and customize.
3.Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.
